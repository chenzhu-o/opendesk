    Parameters
    ----------
    before_png, after_png:
        Raw PNG bytes from :func:`capture_screen`.
    threshold:
        Per-channel intensity delta (0–255) below which a pixel is considered
        unchanged.  Default 10 filters camera / compression noise.
    min_pixels:
        Absolute number of changed pixels required to report a change.
        Defaults to a resolution-scaled value (~41 px at 1920×1080).  A
        *fraction* of the screen is the wrong unit here: a one-glyph edit on a
        4K display changes fewer pixels, proportionally, than a speck of dust
        on a phone, yet only the edit matters.
    min_density:
        Minimum share of the changed region's bounding box that must actually
        differ.  Distinct edits are compact (a glyph, a button, a dialog), so
        their changed pixels fill their bounding box; scattered sensor speckle
        spans a large box while changing few pixels inside it and is rejected.
    ignore_regions:
        Boxes to exclude from the comparison, each ``[x, y, w, h]`` in pixels.
        Ambient churn — a ticking clock, a taskbar, a notification badge — is
        genuine pixel change, so no threshold can tell it from a real edit.
        Excluding where it lives is the only reliable fix.  Build the list from
        the accessibility tree with :func:`regions_for_roles` rather than
        hardcoding coordinates.  Regions are clamped to the image and
        degenerate ones are skipped.

    Returns
    -------
    dict with keys:
        ``changed``         — bool
        ``changed_pixels``  — pixels differing by more than ``threshold``,
                              outside any ignored region
        ``change_fraction`` — ``changed_pixels`` / total pixels, 0.0–1.0
        ``changed_region``  — ``[x, y, w, h]`` bounding box or ``None``
        ``region_area``     — area of that bounding box, or ``None``
        ``region_density``  — ``changed_pixels`` / ``region_area``, or ``None``
        ``suppressed_pixels`` — changed pixels hidden by ``ignore_regions``
        ``ignored_regions`` — the regions actually applied, after clamping
        ``summary``         — human-readable string for the LLM

    Limits
    ------
    This reports *that* pixels differ, not *whether they matter*.  A live clock
    or a moved cursor is a genuine change of a few dozen pixels and will be
    reported as one; so will a one-glyph edit.  Nothing pixel-based can tell the
    two apart — that is a semantic distinction.  Pass ``ignore_regions`` for
    churn in a known place; for churn whose *meaning* you need to judge, compare
    the accessibility tree instead.

    Uses a difference hash (dHash): the image is reduced to a
    ``(hash_size + 1) × hash_size`` grayscale grid and each bit records whether
    a pixel is brighter than its right-hand neighbour.

    What it is actually sensitive to
    --------------------------------
    This is a **structural** signature, and the measured behaviour is narrower
    than "changes when the interface changes".  Rendering 1920×1080 frames and
    comparing against :attr:`_DEFAULT_HASH_SIZE` = 16:

    ==========================  ==================
    change                      Hamming distance
    ==========================  ==================
    identical re-render         0
    clock ticked 1 s            0
    cursor moved                1
    one glyph edited            0
    whole page switched         0
    dialog opened               26
    light → dark theme          40
    ==========================  ==================

    So the bits track layout and overall structure.  Small *content* edits move
    it no more than a cursor does, and a thin high-contrast element (a clock)
    can move it more than a real edit.  Raising ``hash_size`` does not fix this
    — at 32 the same edits read 0–2 bits — because downscaling discards the
    detail a small edit lives in.  No global perceptual hash separates a clock
    tick from a one-glyph edit; that is a semantic distinction, not a
    perceptual one.

    Consequence: use this to answer *"is this the same functional screen?"*, not
    *"did the content change?"*.  For the latter use :func:`diff_screenshots`,
    which resolves individual pixels.  Two fingerprints of the same functional
    screen differ by a few bits, so compare with a tolerance rather than for
    equality — see :func:`fingerprint_distance`.
