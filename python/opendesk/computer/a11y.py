"""Accessibility-tree content diffing — the semantic channel.

Pixels answer "did anything on screen change".  They cannot answer "did the
*content* change": a ticking clock and a one-glyph edit are both a few dozen
pixels of difference, and the two differ in meaning rather than magnitude, so no
threshold separates them.  Global perceptual hashes are no better — they encode
layout, so a dialog opening moves them ~26 bits while a single glyph moves them
zero.

The accessibility tree has no such problem, because it is **text**.  A field
editing from ``100`` to ``150`` is the string change ``"100" → "150"`` — exact,
free of sensor noise, and requiring no model call.  This module makes that the
primary channel for *what* changed, leaving the pixel channel (see
:mod:`opendesk.computer.capture`) to answer *whether* anything changed at all.

Two views, deliberately separate
--------------------------------

* :func:`ui_diff` — a **structural** diff keyed by position in the tree.  It
  answers "what changed", and because the key is structural rather than
  name-derived, a label whose text changed in place is reported as *modified*
  rather than as a removal plus an addition.
* :func:`find_elements` — a **content** query.  It answers "does this element now
  say X", which is what a verifiable reward actually needs: ``Total`` reads
  ``300``, not "the screen looks different".

Example::

    from opendesk.computer.a11y import ui_diff, find_elements

    diff = ui_diff(before_tree, after_tree)
    diff.changed          # True
    diff.modified         # [total: 'Total: 100' -> 'Total: 150']
    diff.summary()        # '1 element(s) changed: ...'

    find_elements(after_tree, name_regex="Total", value_regex=r"^150$")

       and it reports it as ``modified`` rather than as a removal plus an
       addition, precisely because the key is the structural position and not
       the (changed) text.

    Two states hash equal exactly when they present the same roles and the same

    nudged three pixels or a reflowed layout is not a new state, but a single
    edited glyph is.  That is the distinction the perceptual fingerprint cannot
    make, and it is why a state graph can be built on this where it could not be
    built on pixels.

    Ambient churn — the menu-bar clock, a status bar — is pruned by default, so
    a tick is not a state transition.  Without that the digest would be *worse*
    than a pixel hash on a real desktop, where the clock changes every second;
    see :data:`AMBIENT_ROLES`.  Pass ``ignore_roles=None`` for the raw digest
    over everything, or your own list to prune something else.

    Order is kept, so reordering a list *is* a new state — the list got sorted,
    which is something that happened.  Only position on screen is discarded.
